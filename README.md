# FolderScanner
A simple app for cleaning up computer.

## Purpose
Some time ago I was bored and needed to clean up the pc. There are some solutions online, but those that I found were paid. I didn't want to pay for a simple tool so I decided to create my own. This is the result.

## Result
This app is by no means perfect, but it works for me. You can use it too. Modify it, go wild, w/e.

## How to use?
This app runs somewhat like a commandline. When you open it, you should probably pick a folder to scan. There is a bug I need to fix, where parsing crashes out when folder has space in its name lol. 
After you pick a folder to scan, simply type:

```scan <folder_path>```. Don't use \"".

You can also just type ```scan``` and it will scan the folder you are currently in. Use ```cd``` to change it. Should work as intended.

There is rudimentary ```ls``` command that lists all contents of a folder you are currently in with corresponding sizes. There is also ```rmdir``` command that removes a folder. You can probably delete anything with it so be careful. Probably should add some kind of confirmation.

## Future
I will probably make it better in future. I've just wanted to get it out there.
